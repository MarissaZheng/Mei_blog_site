      <description>The PipelinePipe operators and Tidyverse packages have greatly improved my happiness level of writing and reading R code in data tidying, transformation, and visualization. Before, I always found myself writing long code with one function embedded into another function and another, something like h(g(f(x))) but way more complicated, or creating a lot of meaningless intermediate datasets like tmp1 and tmp2.
The pipe along with Tidyverse packages makes the code much more readable.</description>

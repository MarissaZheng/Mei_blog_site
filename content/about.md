My name is Meinizi Zheng. I am an Associate Consultant at [Axtria - Ingenious Insights](https://www.axtria.com/). I earned my master degree from the Department of Statistics and Biostatistics, Rutgers University. You can find more about my academic and professional experience on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meinizi-zheng-841919105/).

This site is mainly for posts of statistics, machine learning and data visualization using R, along with my random thoughts here and there.

I love music and nature. I love traveling but most of the times I travel on Youtube. I record my lifestyle data including exercise data, sleeping data, and visualize them using R. I am always excited to explore new things!

My favorite quote:

> *“Stay hungry, stay foolish!”*

My favorite Bible verse:

> *“Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.” (1 Corinthians 13:6-8)*

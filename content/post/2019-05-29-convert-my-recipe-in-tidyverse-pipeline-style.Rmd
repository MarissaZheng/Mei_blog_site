## The Pipeline

Pipe operators and [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages have greatly improved my happiness level of writing and reading R code in data tidying, transformation, and visualization. Before, I always found myself writing long code with one function embedded into another function and another, something like h(g(f(x))) but way more complicated, or creating a lot of meaningless intermediate datasets like tmp1 and tmp2. 

The pipe along with Tidyverse packages makes the code much more readable. A simple example would be


```{r irirs, results='hide'}
iris %>% 
  filter(Sepal.Length > 4.5) %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(Sepal.Length))
```


And you can read this piece of code as, "Take dataset iris, then filter it, then group it, and then summarize it". 

For those who are not familiar with this powerful tool and are interested to learn more, here is an [article](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial) about where the pipe operator in R comes from, how, when and why you should use them.

## Convert Recipes into Pipelines

I am a fast cook, and I am familiar with most of my saved recipes. Sometimes I check them quickly before cooking just to remind myself of a certain ingredient or the proper oven temperature. Recipes online I saved are too literal (too many words) for me, and I want my recipes to be clear like a cheat sheet. 

Since the pipeline give a clear chain of actions to the dataset (the ingredients in a recipe), and most of my saved recipes are cooked in a "linear" procedure, I find it very helpful to convert them into a pipeline style. 
I will show two dishes as examples.

### Coca-Cola wings

</p>

Coca-Cola wings is one of my favorite Chinese dishes. Here I copy paste a recipe I saved from [appetiteforchina](http://appetiteforchina.com/recipes/coca-cola-chicken-wings).


**Ingredients**

* 2 pounds chicken wings, wings and drummettes separated
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons canola oil
* 2 tablespoons dry sherry or Chinese rice wine
* 3/4 cup Coca-Cola (not diet or anything flavored!)
* 2 scallions, chopped
* A few pinches of freshly ground black pepper

**Instructions**

Put the chicken wings in a large bowl and pour half of the soy sauce on top. Turn the wings so they are well-coated and allow them to marinate for 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature.
Heat a wok or large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken wings until they are golden brown on each side but not cooked through, about 3 minutes each side. Pour in the other half of the soy sauce, the sherry, and the Coke and bring the liquid to a simmer. Simmer the wings uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes, until the liquid is reduced to a glaze.
Season the chicken with black pepper. Transfer the chicken to a plate, garnish with scallions, and serve.


**Convert to Pipeline Version**

```{r, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
chicken wings %>%
  marinate(seasoning = c(salt, cooking wine, white pepper, ginger slice, soy source), time = 10 min) %>%
  fry(add = c(oil), heat = medium, bothside = TRUE, time = 5 min) %>% 
  boil(add = c(cola), heat = high, with_lid = TRUE, time = 5 min) %>% 
  boil(add = NULL, heat = low, with_lid = TRUE, time = 10 min) %>% 
  reduction()
```


### Soybean Sprout Side Dish

</p>


Soybean Sprout Side Dish is one of the most common Korean side dishes, and I like the cruchy and garlicy taste of it. The reciepe I saved is from [Maangchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWfhIq_MiiU&feature=youtu.be), my favorate Korean food Youtuber. 

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound of soybean sprouts, rinsed and drained
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 green onion, chopped
* ½ teaspoon of hot pepper flakes
* 1 teaspoon fish sauce (or soup soy sauce, or salt)
* 1 teaspoon roasted sesame seeds,
* 2 teaspoon roasted sesame oil

**Directions**

Place soybean sprouts in a pot. Add the salt and ½ cup of water and cover. Bring to a boil over medium high heat for 10 minutes. Drain.
Put the cooked soybean sprouts in a mixing bowl. Add garlic, hot pepper flakes, green onion, fish sauce, sesame seeds, and sesame oil and mix by hand.
Transfer to a serving plate.
Serve as a side dish to rice.

**Convert to Pipeline Version**

```{r, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
sprouts %>%
  boil(add = c(water, salt), with_lid = TRUE , time = 10 min) %>%
  drain() %>% 
  add(c(grinded garlic, hot pepper flakes, chopped green onion, fish sauce, sesame seeds, sesame oil))
```



### Some comment

You will notice there is no measure of amount for each ingredient in my recipe pipeline. It is because I am familiar with these dishes and usually just put **a suitable amount**. But if you do a word frequency ranking of a Chinese cooking book, the word **"Shi Liang"**, which means "some" and "suitable amount", will probably be among the tops.
